Instructions for reviewer.

I actually worked on this for about 4 1/2 hours.  Had a couple of hiccups in the beginning that wasted about an hour.  I had to take a break also for something.  

The repository was too big to mail.

So, my approach to this test was to create two PNGs for the stars and overlay the yellow ones over the gray ones (background) and crop the yellow ones as needed by calculating the average, totals for each star, etc...  I used Yeoman to set things up with jQuery, SASS, Angular and also had to make some images in photoshop.  You will need to have the right enviroment to get this up and running but it works (Grunt, etc...).  I did not use an external json file but the data can be easily changed it the main.js file where I put the data and you can see the page change accordingly.   It would be easy to load an expernal file.  I also did a lot of CSS.   It's not perfect but the main needs are met. There is also a screen shot in the repo of the results (page).  Also, as mentioned in the instructions, one can easily change the bar color with the line at top of the main.scss file (see below).  You'll notice I did some things with angular in the html and js files.  If you have any questions, we can go over the code together if you like.

// CHAGE COLOR OF BAR HERE
$bar-color: #ccc;

I can also show this working on my Laptop in person at some future date.

Thanks for the test, it was fun !
